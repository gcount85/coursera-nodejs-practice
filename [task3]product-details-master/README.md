# Problem Statement

Express is middleware-based: It basically funnels incoming requests through a chain of middlewares (of steps) where we can do something with the request, read some data from it, manipulate it, check if the user is authenticated, or basically send back a response immediately. ​

In this Sprint we will be creating RESTful API's using ExpressJS and Routes. 
 Build a REST API using ExpressJS to manage the product details and add new products, fetch all the products available, fetch a specific       product by id, delete a product .

# Tasks

1.Create an Express server to service requests from clients​

2.Create controller, service, DAO, and route layers​

3.Define all HTTP methods like GET, POST and DELETE​

4.Define routes to the below​

 Get all the products​

 Get a product by productid​

 Create a new product and post the data​

 Delete a product by productid

# Instructions

 1.Download and unzip the boilerplate code.
 
 2.Run the command npm install to install the dependencies.
 
 3.Open the boilerplate code in VSCode to develop the assignment solution.
 
 4.Write the logic in **.js** file present in **src** folder
 
 5.Run the test scripts available under src/test by giving the npm run test command in the terminal to test locally.
 
 6.Refactor the solution to ensure all test cases are passing.

 7.Test all REST end points on **POSTMAN**
 
 8.Zip the solution code with the name same as the assignment name.
 
 9.Upload the zipped solution for submission.
